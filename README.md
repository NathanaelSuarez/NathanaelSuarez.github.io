# Nathanael's Website



This website is meant to suggest pictures for **YOU**.

It uses AI (machine learning) to learn to show you images that you are likely to click.





## Credits



**I used Unsplash for the images because they are a great platform that delivers on their original mission**



*I also used clip for the algorithm, but OpenAI isn't as great*
