            <h2>Outcome 1: Generating Inquiry</h2>
            <p>
                I think that to me, Generating Inquiry is the process of turning a general curiosity into a focused and answerable question that can be answered through research. It also involves going from a vague idea to a solid question. This process happened when I was developing the research questions for my first project. My initial interest in the r/aliens subreddit was broad because I just thought that it was interesting how people came to believe conspiracies, and I was curious about government distrust. The "Turning RTs into RQs" activity was helpful, and it helped me get a concrete set of questions to work with. I considered what was actually observable and analyzable within Reddit comments and posts. This helped me get specific researchable questions. The final question I developed "How does ironic content on the r/aliens subreddit contribute to government distrust?" is a direct result of this focused inquiry process. This artifact demonstrates my growth because it shows the exact moment my broad interest was refined into a formal academic question.

            <h2>Outcome 2: Information Literacy</h2>
            <p>
                I think I understand Information Literacy as the ability to evaluate a set of source's relevance, understand their arguments and figure out how they can support my project. It's about ethically and effectively putting sources into conversation with my ideas. My preliminary annotated bibliography, where I found and synthesized two academic sources, is the best artifact to show my progress here because I focused on what made each source useful to me. For example, with a nonacademic article, I identified the concept of irony poisoning becoming sincerity as a useful framework for my analysis, and I recognized that the methodology from the Godwin et al. study, which categorizes different memes into types like "Deception" and "Superiority," could provide to me a structured way for me to analyze the content on r/aliens. This process shows that I am actively evaluating different sources' methods and concepts to make myself a custom research plan, which is the definition of being information literate.

            <h2>Outcome 3: Research Genre Production</h2>
            <p>
                I think this outcome is about understanding that academic writing uses different formats for different jobs. Each format has its own purpose and rules. The CARS model paragraph I wrote on October 1 was my first time practicing one of these formats. I followed its three main steps. First, I established a territory by citing Proferes et al. (2021) to show that online communities are a common place for political talk. Then, I established a niche by explaining that we don't know enough about how memes and irony can shape real political beliefs. Finally, I occupied the niche by stating my research question about the r/aliens subreddit. Because the structure was so clear, I learned that an introduction should get a reader interested, not just be a summary. I feel like I can use this structure again in other projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked with another format in Writing Project 1, where I had to create two different kinds of writing in one document. For the annotated bibliography, I had to follow citation rules, summarize what each source argued, and explain how I would use it. For example, I wrote that De Wildt and Aupers’ idea of “play” and “ludic conspiracies” would help me analyze r/aliens. For the research proposal, I had to follow a different set of rules. I stated my research question, named r/aliens as my main source, explained my reasons for the project, and described my plan. Switching between these two showed me how each part helps. The bibliography helps keep my sources organized, and the proposal provides a clear plan to follow.

            <h2>Outcome 4: Contributing Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                I believe this outcome is about learning to add my own ideas to an academic conversation instead of just reporting on what others have said. This means I have to find new evidence, interpret it myself, and then connect my conclusion to other scholars' work. My final paper, Writing Project 2, was my attempt to do this. I gathered my own evidence by reading through many comment threads on r/aliens, like the one about the New Jersey state senator and the UAP video. I interpreted jokes like, “At this stage, aliens would be one of the less scary outcomes,” as a kind of playful cynicism. But I also saw that users were quick to debunk a blurry video of an airplane.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeing this mix of humor and fact-checking helped me come to my own conclusion. I argued that the ironic talk on r/aliens builds distrust in a complex way. It's not just "irony poisoning" but a mix of jokes and serious fact-checking inside the community. I connected this idea to other scholars' work to support my point. I used De Wildt and Aupers’ concept of “ludic conspiracies” to explain the playful side and Gaudette and Scrivens’ work on echo chambers to show how the subreddit tries to avoid being one.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “Methodologizing with Friends” assignment helped me learn how to form that conclusion. In that assignment, I collected Reddit comments and tried to label them as “ironic” or “sincere.” I remember writing, “It was kind of hard to categorize something as strictly ironic or not ironic. So I might need a framework for unclear examples.” Realizing this problem pushed me to use the “Play, Belief, Doubt” framework from my sources. This showed me that using concepts from scholars is a good way to organize and understand my own evidence.
