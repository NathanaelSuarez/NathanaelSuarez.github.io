        <p>This portfolio showcases my work on online discourse on how irony and memetic content on the r/aliens subreddit contributes to government distrust.

        <div id="generating-inquiry" class="tab-content" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Outcome 1: Generating Inquiry</h2>
            <p>
                I think that to me, Generating Inquiry is the process of turning a general curiosity into a focused and answerable question that can be answered through research. It also involves going from a vague idea to a solid question. This process happened when I was developing the research questions for my first project. My initial interest in the r/aliens subreddit was broad because I just thought that it was interesting how people came to believe conspiracies, and I was curious about government distrust. The "Turning RTs into RQs" activity was helpful, and it helped me get a concrete set of questions to work with. I considered what was actually observable and analyzable within Reddit comments and posts. This helped me get specific researchable questions. The final question I developed "How does ironic content on the r/aliens subreddit contribute to government distrust?" is a direct result of this focused inquiry process. I also built the foundation for these questions by learning topics like the rhetorical situation in the Friday Warmup Exercise. This artifact demonstrates my growth because it shows the exact moment my broad interest was refined into a formal academic question.

            <h2>Outcome 2: Information Literacy</h2>
            <p>
                I think I understand Information Literacy as the ability to evaluate a set of source's relevance, understand their arguments and figure out how they can support my project. It's about ethically and effectively putting sources into conversation with my ideas. My preliminary annotated bibliography, where I found and synthesized two academic sources, is the best artifact to show my progress here because I focused on what made each source useful to me. For example, with a nonacademic article, I identified the concept of irony poisoning becoming sincerity as a useful framework for my analysis, and I recognized that the methodology from the Godwin et al. study, which categorizes different memes into types like "Deception" and "Superiority," could provide to me a structured way for me to analyze the content on r/aliens. In addition to the full bibliography, I also practiced these methods with the baby bib assignment. This process shows that I am actively evaluating different sources' methods and concepts to make myself a custom research plan, which is the definition of being information literate.

            <h2>Outcome 3: Research Genre Production</h2>
            <p>
                I think this outcome is about understanding that academic writing uses different formats for different jobs. Each format has its own purpose and rules. The CARS model paragraph I wrote on October 1 was my first time practicing one of these formats. I followed its three main steps. First, I established a territory by citing Proferes et al. (2021) to show that online communities are a common place for political talk. Then, I established a niche by explaining that we don't know enough about how memes and irony can shape real political beliefs. Finally, I occupied the niche by stating my research question about the r/aliens subreddit. Because the structure was so clear, I learned that an introduction should get a reader interested, not just be a summary. Similarly, in the research proposal, I had to figure out a different set of contraints like explaining the value of the specific research. I feel like I can use this structure again in other projects.

        <div id="contributing-knowledge" class="tab-content" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Outcome 4: Contributing Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                I believe this outcome is about learning to add my own ideas to an academic conversation instead of just reporting on what others have said. This means I have to find new evidence, interpret it myself, and then connect my conclusion to other scholars' work. My final paper, Writing Project 2, was my attempt to do this. I gathered my own evidence by reading through many comment threads on r/aliens, like the one about the New Jersey state senator and the UAP video. I interpreted jokes like, “At this stage, aliens would be one of the less scary outcomes,” as a kind of playful cynicism. But I also saw that users were quick to debunk a blurry video of an airplane.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeing this mix of humor and fact-checking helped me come to my own conclusion. I argued that the ironic talk on r/aliens builds distrust in a complex way. It's not just "irony poisoning" but a mix of jokes and serious fact-checking inside the community. I connected this idea to other scholars' work to support my point. I used De Wildt and Aupers’ concept of “ludic conspiracies” to explain the playful side and Gaudette and Scrivens’ work on echo chambers to show how the subreddit tries to avoid being one. I also helped to contribute knowledge by making my presentation to share with the other members of my class.

        <div id="revision" class="tab-content" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Outcome 5: Revision</h2>
            <p>
                I think revision is about being willing to change your entire argument when the evidence demands it and fixing your errors. In my Self Reflection for Project 2 (At bottom of Project 2 Final Draft), I documented exactly how this happened. When I first wrote my research question, I had a simple theory that I expected to find irony poisoning where jokes turned into sincere beliefs in a straight line. I assumed the r/aliens community was an echo chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, during my data collection, I found a thread debunking a UAP video. The users were using flight path data to prove the video was fake. This evidence completely contradicted my original hypothesis. I had to revise my paper to argue that the community actually has a strong culture of internal skepticism. As I wrote in my reflection: "This realization was the turning point in my analysis." The peer review assignment also helped with the revision process because it helped me find areas in my paper that needed improvement. This artifact demonstrates that I can negotiate differences between my assumptions and my findings and revise my work to be more accurate.

            <h2>Outcome 6: Multiple Ways of Writing</h2>
            <p>
                I think that this outcome focuses on integrating multimodality like using visuals, design, and different modes of communication to support a goal. My genre Task presentation slides demonstrate this ability. Instead of just writing a paragraph about my methodology, I made a visual powerpoint to explain it.
            </p>
            <p>
                On slide 5, I used a screenshot of a real Reddit thread and used handwriting annotations in red to visually demonstrate to the audience how I coded the data. This visual approach made the abstract concept of discourse coding much easier for an audience to understand instantly. By combining text, screenshots, and digital handwriting, I utilized multiple modes to communicate my research methods more effectively than text alone could have. I think that the Cartesian Graph was also a good demonstration of of multiple ways of writing because it shows a form of communication through a dotplot and a legend.
